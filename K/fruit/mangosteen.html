    <p>Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana), also known as the purple mangosteen,[1] is a tropical evergreen tree with edible fruit native to island nations of Southeast Asia. Its origin is uncertain due to widespread prehistoric cultivation.[2][3] It grows mainly in Southeast Asia, southwest India and other tropical areas such as Colombia, Puerto Rico and Florida,[2][4][5] where the tree has been introduced. The tree grows from 6 to 25 m (19.7 to 82.0 ft) tall.[2] The fruit of the mangosteen is sweet and tangy, juicy, somewhat fibrous, with fluid-filled vesicles (like the flesh of citrus fruits), with an inedible, deep reddish-purple colored rind (exocarp) when ripe.[2][4] In each fruit, the fragrant edible flesh that surrounds each seed is botanically endocarp, i.e., the inner layer of the ovary.[6][7] Seeds are almond-shaped and -sized.
