    <p>The rambutan (/ræmˈbuːtən/, taxonomic name: Nephelium lappaceum) is a medium-sized tropical tree in the family Sapindaceae. The name also refers to the edible fruit produced by this tree. The rambutan is native to Southeast Asia.[1] It is closely related to several other edible tropical fruits including the lychee, longan, pulasan and mamoncillo.
